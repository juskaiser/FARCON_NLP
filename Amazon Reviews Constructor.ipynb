I hard wired it into my home network and used a digital cable to go into my A/V Receiver. I now have a massive collection of digital audio from Rhapsody to choose from. I'm in heaven. The unit was as easy as pie to hook up. The touch screen is reactive, and the remote control is very nice too. What a fabulous product. It does everything I was looking for and more. The fact that Amazon got it here fast and at a reasonable price just makes my enjoyment of it that much more. I love my Squeezebox Touch and I love Amazon. Thanks\n",

It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it does the basic job of getting you from point A to point B with minimal difficulties.This is our second GPS unit.  My husband received a GPS unit made by another manufacturor for his birthday and it was more expensive with some special features.  It has had a few hiccups nevertheless.  I wanted a GPS for my vehicle and decided to give this one a try.It is very easy to use.  The brightness level doesn't always seem to go quite bright enough in the bright sunshine on my dash.  The display while driving sometimes appears jumpy and bumpy.  But this unit's speaker is louder than my husbands and hasn't frozen up like his either.  The pros outweigh the cons without a doubt.If you are looking for a basic GPS unit and do not want to pay for all the bells and whistles, I would highly recommend giving this one a try.\n",

The 2.0 drive took 2'35&#34; while this drive in a USB3.0 slot took 1'02&#34;.  Quite impressive.  I also copied a folder of MP3 files which was 95MB in size (8 total files).

Unlike other headsets, these do not have any way to change out the ear pieces.  So, if you have small or even average ear canals, these are NOT going to work for you.What is even more amazing is that the company refuses to do anything about it.  There are hundreds of complaints about the earpieces falling out, not fitting, uncomfortable... etc.  The response from Plantronics is just \"IGNORE\".  Too bad.  They used to be a good company but the dollar has taken over their office, I guess.So, caveat emptor. These will probably NOT fit you!!\n",
