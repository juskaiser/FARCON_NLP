      "['Eneloop batteries are such a great value.  This kit is a great starter.  I have had one for several years and bought this one to get my Dad started.  He was using alkaline batteries in his Digital Camera.  I do that in a pinch at DisneyLand but otherwise they go through batteries way too quickly.  Get Eneloops and stop wasting money on every new set of batteries.This kit costs approx 4x what a comparable set of alkaline batteries will.  After the 4th charge it will be money in the bank for every recharge after that.Eneloops are not the rechargeable batteries of the past.  They do not have \"memory\" problems.  They carry sufficient charge to be an alkaline replacement.  They recharge quickly (as quick as 1 hour with the right charger).  They do not loose charge like traditional rechargeable batteries.  They will retain 80% of their charge 1 year later sitting on a shelf.If you haven\\'t tried Eneloop yet stop wondering and buy these.', \"I am well aware that some will accuse me of bias here. However,let me point out that when I bought the first gen iPad I compared to to my Vaio X Netbook and I had come to the conclusion that if I had to give up one of the twit would be the iPad.Now, a year and a half later I have an iPad 2 and instead of getting another iPad I decided to get the Samsung Tab 10.1 from Staples. Here are my pros and cons of the Tab v. The iPad 2. Overall,  if I had to choose just one it would be a no contest. The iPad 2 is a much better tablet - unless you are predisposed Android. So here is how they stacked up for me:1. Look and feel - iPad. The iPad has a form factor that allows it to be used in portrait and landscape mode, the Tab is unnatural in portrait mode (too long and thin). The metal back and minimalist styling of the iPad also beats the plasticy but slim Tab. The Tab however, is better than any other Android Tablet in look and feel by a mile. Also, i bet most people will prefer the physical home button on the iPad 2 and the absolute simplicity in finding and using apps. The Tab has some superfluous widgets like the weather and others to can put on the home screen. But again, unless you are an Android fan already they do NOT enhance the tablet experience.2. Apps - iPad. It does not matter what you use your tablet for. Movies, games, office productivity apps, taking notes, video chatting...the apps on the iPad are simply a notch above the Tab. While Flash works great on the Tab, 99%of the time what you'll see are e annoying flash ads. Plus, what I have found is that there are very very few sites that you can't access the main content because of flash. If you can't get to the web site, they have an app. and the app is always better than the flash site. Be aware that3. Display - Tie. You have to do a side by side to realize that both are the same when it comes t web sites and text. However, there are way more iPad specific apps than their are apps for the Tab. In all cases, those apps look much better on the iPad. This includes Amazon Mobile, Pandora and Skype and of course many many games. In reality, if you want to use the display of your tablet to the max, the ipad gives you way more content to work with.4. Media - iPad. The convenience of the iTunes store and the iPod media player is simply better in my opinion. You should decode which you prefer5. Battery life - iPad. At least 30-40% better battery life.6. Accessories- iPad . The smart case + tons of 3rd party.7. Camera - Tab on specs, but same for video chatting. If you use the camera on your tablet for taking photos. However, for video chatting both look exactly the same to the receiver. It does not matter that the front camera on the Tab is higher resolution, the performance is the same when video chatting. Also, FaceTime on the iPad is the easiest to use and the best if the receiver is also on an iOS devce. Finally, there is no Tab equivalent for Skype on the iPad - which I use as my default video chatting device.8. Web Browser - Tab. The web browser on the Tab is faster and allows you to access flash sites. With the iPad you'll need to buy an app to view flash. There are multiple apps on the app store that you can use to view flash. So it is NOT true that you cannot access flash from an iPad - you can't from the Safari browser.9. EBooks reader- iPad. All the eBookstore apps are optimized for the iPad, while none of the major ebookstores have apps optimized for the Tab.10. Others - AirPlay is another neat iPad feature if you have an Apple TV.It should not be surprising that 8/10 people will prefer the iPad to the Tab. Those who claim that people are buying the iPad over the Tab only because they are loyal to the Apple brand are misinformed. I just listed 9 reasons. I don't care whether it is locked down or not. Customizing the home page is not the reason to own a tablet. If it is for you....then go for the Tab.I own a Tab. It is a good tablet in it's own way. It just isn't better than an iPad 2 - not even close when you consider all things.\"]\n",

      "[\"this is my first mac. my PC broke and i didn't want to hassle with it anymore so i took the chance and bit into the apple.i already have a nice sony monitor so i purchased the mini (with 1g RAM) and the wireless keyboard and mouse. i've had my mini for a week and love it.it was easy to set up right out the box. my network was recognized and i was doing basic stuff like surfing the internet, working with pictures, and using iTunes without a problem. i was pleasantly surprised to find inexpensive 3rd party apps and was doing fun stuff like ripping dvd's to my iPod and downloading from usenet. i  have had no problems playing any movie from my huge avi collection.overall this is just a nice system to work and play on. it seems fast compared to my PC (Windows XP, pentium IV @ 3g with 2000 RAM) and has the feel of a modern computer.i am giving it 4 stars since music is really important to me and i was initially freaking out in regards to audio quality. it just didn't sound as good as the music from my PC (which had a soundblaster audio card). so i purchased the soundblaster XFi and that helped some. still disapointed i further experimented and then tried turning down the system sound (i now have mine about 25%) and let the amp in my bose companion 3 speakers do the work. this made my music sound sweet and was a big relief. i am picky though, so if you think mp3's encoded @ 128k sound OK then audio probably won't be an issue.so i just like this thing!! i have the mini with OS X and a toshiba qosmio running XP; the mini is just more pleasant to use.\", 'I waited 2 years before posting a review so I could use this tripod extensively.  As a low/no budget filmmaker, I really enjoy working with it.  The fluid head makes for some extremely smooth pans/camera movements.  Plus it is wicked sturdy and easy to adjust.

got from Kingston, i can tell that SanDisk is other quality, this is the best, my i9300 phone can read a 64GB very fast, the dta transfer speed from my pc to my is amazing, if you are looking for additional storage to you phone, for music, pictures and other type of files, this is for you.Pros-Very good quality materials of construction-Amazing speedUpdate after one year this memory is damaged I can not delete or put new files on it, I can not format this memory, I tried to format with my phone, with my pc, with a camera and nothing, now this is like a 64gb cd, the data in the memory is only available to read but I can not move, or delete it, I bought this memory to be used to backup all my data of my android device but now is only a readable memory I can not write data on it any more, I hope sandisk make a better products in the future!!!

The write speed on this card is between 7 and 10 MB/s, the read seems to be 35MB/s, compared to the full size card with write speed of 22 to 25MB/s and a read speed of 42MB/s (this is from an imaging program, not a benchmark program, so it's not checking different sizes of transfer and the like). Compare that with a Transcend 4 GB Class 4 card, the write speed is nearly identical (7 to 9MB/s), while the read speed on the class four is 12 to 13MB/s, significantly slower, as expected.The read speed is good, but the write speed is abysmal!

I copied over music, pics and movies to test it out ranging from a couple of mb to over a gb. The read speeds were pretty good at around 21mb/s though. I popped in a 32gb class 10 transcend SD card and it consistently got 16-18mb/s write speeds and 24mb/s read speeds. So in conclusion I think this card is not really a class 10.

The mistake I made was that I didn't use the card right away to see if it was good -I thought, its a memory card, what could go wrong. Now I'm out of the US and returning it is not economically sensible. I don't know if it's quality control, but this card simply cannot work in any reader, device, with or without adapter (write protection off on the reader of course). The card shows up on devices, may even show data being copied then when you refresh, nothing has happened. All formatting software says it's write protected and nothing I do can remove it. Why would a new card come write protected anyway? Very disappointing, especially since I lost data from my phone.\",\"These are genuine Sandisk memory cards, but from a defective batch.

What upsets me is that this is not my first bad experience with SanDisk products. I used to buy them all the time, they were my brand of choice for flash memory (cards or thumb drives). The last three products I have bought from them have had problems and failed either immediately or shortly after usage. So I give up. I will start looking to other companies for my memory needs.

There are 492 similar complaints about this card (now 493...) and this is 17.5% of 1 star out of 2918 reviews... At first I thought it was my phone not being able to find it, or the card would often spontaneously dismount, and there were the frequent and repeated alerts for me to format the card. Formatting the card only cured the problem for a day or two... Plugged it into the desktop directly, and the same thing happened. Got another card of another brand, and everything has been working well since early March 2013 with the other card. So it was not the phone but the card that is at fault. Very poor longevity. The price is right, but at the end not worth it if you need to buy another card to replace it.

But if you notice the bad reviews involve the card becoming unreliable after a couple weeks of use. Typically people write reviews shortly after receiving the product. My card worked fine for 2 weeks and then started having problems. I re-formatted the card, re-inserted in the phone, removed the battery, every trick I could read about but the card still remained unreliable and the phone was thinking it was being removed at random times. So I stuck my olders, slower 8GB microSD card in, worked fine.I suspect one or both is happening with this card:(a) Some cards are defective but it takes some usage for them to start failing to where the user notices.(b) For some reason, this brand of card doesn't like certain devices, like my Samsung Galaxy S3My guess is I got a lemon, but I'm not chancing it to getting another one and will just move on to another reputable brand.\\\"You get what you pay for\\\" may be applicable here.

I have never had any problems. After installing this card, however, I have seen it unmounting itself randomly to be detected again and automatically being mounted by my Galaxy S4 device. This happens several times a day, including when I am in the middle of watching a movie on the phone (this is the first week that I have had the card). This is unacceptable. Normally, I would have just asked for a replacement, but after doing some research online, I have found out that this seems to be a recurrent problem on many phone models and doesn't seem to be just \\\"a dud\\\", but a production issue.
